# Developer setup notes

## AWS CDK

The CDK app is configured via the repository root `cdk.json`. From the repository root you can run:

```bash
npm run cdk:venv
npm run cdk:list
npm run cdk:synth
npm run cdk:diff
npm run cdk:deploy
```

These commands rely on CDK's default auto-discovery, so no additional `-a` flags or wrapper scripts are required. Run `npm run cdk:venv` whenever dependencies change to refresh the virtual environment.

> **Runtime requirement:** Install Python 3.11 and Node.js 20 LTS (20.x) locally so the CLI matches the GitHub Actions runners. After switching Node versions with tools like `nvm`, `fnm`, or Volta, confirm the runtime with `node --version`â€”the output should start with `v20`.
