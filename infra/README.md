# Infrastructure Overview

Infrastructure-as-code for releasecopilot-ai lives under `cdk/`. The
[`scripts/package_lambda.sh`](../scripts/package_lambda.sh) helper packages the
Lambda adapter before deployment. Refer to [`cdk/README.md`](../cdk/README.md)
for detailed instructions on synthesising and deploying the stacks.
