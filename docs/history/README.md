# Git Historian Snapshots

The `docs/history` folder contains weekly and on-demand project history check-ins generated by the Git Historian tooling.

Each file follows the `YYYY-MM-DD-checkin.md` naming convention and is produced from [`scripts/generate_history.py`](../../scripts/generate_history.py) using the [history template](HISTORY_TEMPLATE.md). The generator aggregates recently closed issues, merged pull requests, notable decisions, and artifact references.

In addition to the human-readable Markdown snapshots, the generator keeps an updated machine-readable index at
[`docs/context/context-index.json`](../context/context-index.json) so other automation (such as RAG pipelines) can easily discover the
latest check-ins.

See [Git Historian (How to Run)](../git-historian.md) for full usage instructions, including how to run the generator locally, schedule automated updates, and customize the output.
