# Prompt Recipes

Every Wave 1 sub-prompt must have an accompanying recipe stored here.

| Sub-Prompt | Recipe |
|------------|--------|
| `project/prompts/wave1/subprompt_budget_alarms.md` | `project/prompts/prompt_recipes/budget_alerts_recipe.md` |

Use `template.md` when creating new recipes. The validator reads the `Sub-Prompt Path` field inside each recipe to confirm coverage.
